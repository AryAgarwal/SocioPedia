# SocioPedia
Sociopedia is a backend social media website.It allows users to post pictures, update posts, add as well as remove friends, liek and commment on the posts as well.
It uses ExpressJS and NodeJS to create the backend for the website.
# Edits
In the future, I'm going to add the frontend using ReactJS.
I will also connect it to MongoDB to store all users data.
